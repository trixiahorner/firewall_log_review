# Firewall Log Review / Log parsing
The purpose of this lab is to understand how to go through and parse log files. Understanding how to parse log files is an essential skill for any cybersecurity professional. Whether retrieving logs from an Apache server or a Windows computer system, the ability to effectively parse these logs is crucial. This skill is applicable to virtually any logging format on any server you may encounter. Key techniques include using tools like grep to extract specific data, employing the -v option to filter out unwanted information, utilizing cut to isolate specific fields, and performing basic mathematical operations on the data. Mastering these techniques ensures you can efficiently analyze and interpret log files in various environments.

## Environment and setup
This lab is part of the Antisyphon Training SOC Core Skills course with John Strand. Visit [Antisyphon](https://www.antisyphontraining.com/) for more information.

Before reviewing the logs, cd into the correct directory. And we need to do some installing (r-base-core for some mathematical computations and data analysis.)
```
cd /mnt/c/IntroLabs
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install r-base-core --fix-missing
```
<br>
<br>

## Methodology
### 1. Let's start by just going through the logs
```
less ASA-syslogs.txt
```
![ASAlogs](https://github.com/trixiahorner/firewall_log_review/blob/main/images/F1.png?raw=true)
<br>
This is a lot of information!The goal of this lab is to see how we can go through all of this to the point where we can start to understand and get some passable data. 
<br>
The first thing we can see is that 24.230.56.6 is getting a lot of traffic. This is just a local gateway and we aren't interested in it. You can press *q* to quit.
<br>
<br>

### 2. We can grep on the suspect IP address and clear out the local gateway
```
grep 192.168.1.6 ASA-syslogs.txt | grep -v 24.230.56.6 | less
```
![grep](https://github.com/trixiahorner/firewall_log_review/blob/main/images/F2.png?raw=true)
<br>
<br>

### 3. We can clean it up even more.
We donâ€™t necessarily care about all the different fields. Let's focus on the closed connections (FIN) and pull just specific fields out of the data to clean it up. We use cut with the -d switch to tell cut the delimiter is a space. Then, we tell it what fields we are interested in.
```
grep 192.168.1.6 ASA-syslogs.txt | grep -v 24.230.56.6 | grep FIN | cut -d ' ' -f 1,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14
```
![grepFIN](https://github.com/trixiahorner/firewall_log_review/blob/main/images/F3.png?raw=true)
<br>
We see that the suspect IP is just communicating with two IP addresses again and again
<br>
<br>

### 4. Look at those specific IPs
First, let's look at the connections with 13.107.237.38. We want to drill down and see just data from that IP address
```
grep 192.168.1.6 ASA-syslogs.txt | grep -v 24.230.56.6 | grep FIN | grep 13.107.237.38 | cut -d ' ' -f 1,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14
```
![IP1](https://github.com/trixiahorner/firewall_log_review/blob/main/images/F4.png?raw=true)
<br>
I notice that the byes are kind of close to eachother
<br>
<br>

There are also a lot of connections from 18.160.185.174 as well, so let's zoom in on that IP address
```
grep 192.168.1.6 ASA-syslogs.txt | grep -v 24.230.56.6 | grep FIN | grep 18.160.185.174 | cut -d ' ' -f 1,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14
```
![IP2](https://github.com/trixiahorner/firewall_log_review/blob/main/images/F5.png?raw=true)
<br>
I see a pattern with the bytes field.
<br>
<br>

### 5. Let's concentrate on just that field
```
grep 192.168.1.6 ASA-syslogs.txt | grep -v 24.230.56.6 | grep FIN | grep 18.160.185.174 | cut -d ' ' -f 14
```
![byte](https://github.com/trixiahorner/firewall_log_review/blob/main/images/F6.png?raw=true)
<br>
<br>

### 6. Let's run those bytes through a mathematical formula
This command asks for the minimum/maximum, the mean, the standard deviation, and the variance.
```
grep 192.168.1.6 ASA-syslogs.txt | grep -v 24.230.56.6 | grep FIN | grep 18.160.185.174 | cut -d ' ' -f 8,14 | tr : ' ' | tr / ' '  | cut -d ' ' -f 4 | Rscript -e 'y <-scan("stdin", quiet=TRUE)' -e 'cat(min(y), max(y), mean(y), sd(y), var(y), sep="\n")'
```
![math](https://github.com/trixiahorner/firewall_log_review/blob/main/images/F7.png?raw=true)
<br>
- Minimum: 1816
- Maximum: 1848
- Mean: 1829.805
- SD: 12.20163
- Variance: 151.33
<br>
This is a beacon! This regularity in the intervals, with minimal deviation, is a strong indicator of a beacon, which is often used by malware for periodic communication with a C2 server.
<br>

# Conclusion
The identification of beaconing behavior through log analysis exemplifies the importance of these skills. The narrow range between minimum and maximum intervals, coupled with low standard deviation and variance, points to consistent and predictable intervals. This regularity is a hallmark of beaconing, where a compromised system frequently "checks in" with a C2 server at nearly fixed intervals. Recognizing this pattern is a critical indicator of a beacon, often used by malware for periodic communication with a C2 server. Through effective log parsing, you can detect such malicious activities and enhance your cybersecurity defenses.
